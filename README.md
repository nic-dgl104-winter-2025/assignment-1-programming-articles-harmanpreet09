# Programming Practice Article (Code Review)
# Introduction
Code reviews are a fundamental part of software development, ensuring higher code quality, early detection of issues, and collective learning within a team. For DGL 104 students, developing strong code review habits will sharpen their programming skills and prepare them for collaborative projects. In this article, we explore the significance of code reviews, best practices, and practical examples to help you build confidence in reviewing and receiving feedback on code.
# Why Code Review Matters
1. Improved Code Quality: They help detect issues early, ensuring consistent standards and leading to robust software.
2. Knowledge Sharing: Developers learn reliable techniques and best practices through collaborative reviews.
3. Better Documentation: Reviews assist teams in creating better documentation, facilitating future feature additions and upgrades.
4. Easier QA Testing: Consistent code standards make it simpler for specialists and testers to understand and assess the code.
# Best Practices for Effective Code Reviews
To make your code reviews effective:
1. Review Small Chunks of Code: Itâ€™s easier to understand and catch issues in smaller pieces.
2. Give Clear, Helpful Feedback: Be polite and offer solutions.
3. Focus on Clarity: Check if the code is easy to read and maintain.
4. Check for Security Risks: Look for issues like unsafe user inputs
5. Use Tools to Help: Linters and analyzers can catch simple errors automatically.
6. Think About Edge Cases: Test how the code performs under unexpected conditions.
# Code Examples and Reviews
## Refactoring for Efficiency (Source: Google Engineering Practices)
```
// Original
function sumArray(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  return sum;
}

// Improved Version
function sumArray(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
}
```
## Example 2: Catching a Logical Bug (Source: Stack Overflow Blog)
```
// Original
function isPositive(num) {
  return num > 0;
}
console.log(isPositive(0)); // Returns false, but may be unexpected

// Improved Version
function isPositive(num) {
  return num >= 0;
}
```
## Example 3: Improving Security with Input Validation (Source: Atlassian Blog)
```
// Original
function processInput(input) {
  eval(input); // Dangerous!
}

// Secure Version
function processInput(input) {
  if (typeof input === 'string') {
    console.log(input);
  }
}
```
## Example 4: Consistent Style with Linters (Source: GitHub Docs)
```
// Original (Inconsistent Style)
let sum=0;
for(let i=0;i<10;i++){sum+=i;}

// Corrected Version
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
```
# Code Review Checklist
1. Functionality :- The code should meet all requirements and handle errors gracefully. It should cover different scenarios, including edge cases. For example, the code below reads from a file, processes it, and handles errors if the file is missing:
  ```
try:
    with open("inputfile.txt", "r") as f:
        lines = f.readlines()

    with open("outputfile.txt", "w") as f:
        for line in lines:
            f.write(line.strip().upper())

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Input file not found")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
  ```
